# ðŸ“¦ Generic Data Ingestor Framework for Semi-Structured Data Sources

## ðŸš€ Overview

A fully dynamic, self-adapting, zero-configuration data ingestion framework written in Python. This tool detects, parses, infers schema, tracks metadata, handles schema evolution, and loads data from semi-structured sources (JSON, CSV, and Parquet) into a relational database with minimal setup.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Ingest JSON, CSV, and Parquet files dynamically
- Automatically infer and adapt to schema changes
- Track file metadata and ingestion history
- Support full load, append, and UPSERT strategies
- Provide CLI interface for easy testing and execution
- Maintain robust logging and metadata tracking
